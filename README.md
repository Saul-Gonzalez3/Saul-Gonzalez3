### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a student at Codeup, where they teach students all the technical skills to become a data scientist. 

I'm currently learning about Unsupervised Machine Learning, specifically Clustering, , common clustering algorithms, Anomoly Detection, & NLP.

âš¡ Fun fact: ... I'm a huge sports fan, particularly the Philadelphia Eagles.
